            <h3> The project that I'm currently working on is a diorama of a ruined cathedral wherein a group of Adepta Sororitas makes a deesperate final stand against a tide of daemon possessed cultists led by a master of possession. The sketch pictured above was the preliminary sketch of my idea for the diorama. </h3>

            <h3> This project was done for a 3D modeling and digital fabrication class, so all the initial filework (pictured above) was done in Adobe Illustrator. I wanted a big focus on the stained glass in the back so I made sure to make that feel like it towers above the rest of the cathedral.</h3>

            <h3> The first prototype had interesting results and a LOT to learn. For one I got some of the base sizes wrong so they were too big, but that's an easy fix. The second thing is that I'm making a promise never to use Gorilla Glue again because it expanded way more than I anticipated. I also learned that I very much so needed to add tabs and inserts in the island base because I could not eyeball the placement of the walls.</h3>

            <h3> The assembly and painting of the building itself still feels a bit like a fever dream because it was done in a nonstop 24-hour painting session. Overall I'm pretty happy with how the buidling itself turned out, the stained glass looks pretty nice and the brick texture is very basic but it gets the job done. I wasn't able to get the miniatures painted in time for the class presentation unfortunately but that'll be my next step. I'm most excited for this flamethrower effect I have planned. </h3>
